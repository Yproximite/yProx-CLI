## Development workflow

You need to install dependencies first:
```bash
$ yarn
```

### Tests and specs

Tests and specs are located inside the `test` folder. You can run them with:
```bash
$ yarn test
```

Be sure to always add a test when you are modifying something!

### Linting

We use [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) and the [AirBnb preset](https://github.com/progre/tslint-config-airbnb) (with some tweaked rules). 

You can lint the code with:

```bash
$ yarn lint
$ yarn lint --fix #Â will automatically fix some errors
```
